These are all the unit tests for Stackbox. They're written using the [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) JavaScript unit testing framework.

## Run the tests:
Open `test/local.html` in your browser. QUnit will now run all the tests in `test/test.js` and present the results.

You may also run the tests from the command line. To do so, type in the following:

``` bash
$ grunt test-local
```

The `index.html` file is only meant to be used for automatic testing on Travis CI.
